# App to know which movies are playing at cinemas

I use TMDB API to fetch current movies.

## Before running the app
You need to do:
1. Create a file called `<whatever you want>.env.dart`
2. Edit the file called `example_api_keys.env.dart` to `api_keys.env.dart`
3. Put your API key on the variable that the file contains.
4. On the terminal run `flutter pub get`.

## Running the app
Run `flutter run`.
